# The-Man-Behind-The-Slaughter
A FNAF Fan-Game by Elliot Kelleher

Hey! I'm Elliot, and I'm making my own FNAF fan-game, about William Afton, right now, the game is in it's prototype phase, so there's not much going on other than some mechanic testing, but if you want to try it feel free!

# PLANNED STORY (SPOILERS)
Seven Chapters about William Afton, and events depicted or refrenced in the main FNAF games by Scott Cawthon.

**Prologue** Opening of Fredbear's Family Diner, late 1970's, introduce characters and mechanics and building up the Diner.
**Chapter I: 1983** Death of Charlotte Emily (later The Puppet), things related to that, the Bite of '83 (Death of Evan Afton/C.C) and closing of Fredbear's Family Diner.
**Chapter II: 1985** Opening of the first Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, managing that, relationship issues with Henry and Michael and the MCI.
**Chapter III: 1987** Opening of another Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, building animatronics, managing Withereds and the Bite of '87.
**Chapter IV: 1988-1993** Opening of the last Freddy Fazbear's Pizza (the FNAF 1 location), managing that, court about MCI and springlock faliure.
**Chapter V: 2023 Pt. 1** Being found in pizzeria, finding Michael, events of FNAF 3 and burning down of Fazbear Frights.
**Chapter VI: 2023 Pt. 2** Surviving the fire, trying to find Michael, events of FNAF 6 (Pizzaria Sim) and burning to death.
**Epilogue** Hell, some of UCN.

Of course, a lot of this is wishful thinking, as I barely know Unity and C#, so any help would be appreciated, a small amount of pay may be on the table. If intrested, HMU on Discord (@TheCrazoMan) or Reddit (@TheRealCrazoMan)
